The exporter grabs Facebook group information and imports it to MySQL. The frontend boilerplate supports both desktop and mobile.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nYou should first setup import.php.\r\n\r\nYou first need to get your Facebook group ID (GID) and access token (for open groups a nonexpire token can be used).\r\n\r\nFill in the MySQL information, GID, and access token in config.php.\r\n\r\nAttempt to run the script in console: php import.php. If all goes to plan your MySQL should be populated.\r\n\r\nAdd the import to crontab every minute to ensure your database is up to date with Facebook by adding:\r\n> 0 * * * * php /var/www/import.php >/dev/null 2>&1\r\n\r\nFrom there you may attempt to load the front end which searchs the same database and uses the same config.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Problems:\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe main.js file contains the word gid in the link back to Facebook when in reality it should be the group ID. This was hardcoded before and needs to be automatic.\r\n","google":"UA-40111352-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
