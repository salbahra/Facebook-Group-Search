The exporter grabs Facebook group information and imports it to MySQL. The frontend boilerplate supports searching the database on both desktop and mobile.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n+ You first need to get your Facebook group ID (GID) and access token (for open groups a no-expire application token can be used).\r\n  + More information [can be found here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/howtos/publishing-with-app-token/)\r\n\r\n+ Fill in the MySQL information, GID, and access token in config.php.\r\n\r\n+ Attempt to run the script in console: php import.php. If all goes to plan your MySQL should be populated.\r\n\r\n+ Add the import to crontab every minute to ensure your database is up to date with Facebook by adding:\r\n\r\n  + ``` 0 * * * * php /var/www/import.php >/dev/null 2>&1 ```\r\n\r\n+ From there you may attempt to load the front end which searchs the same database and uses the same config.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Problems:\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe main.js file contains the word gid in the link back to Facebook when in reality it should be the group ID. This was hardcoded before and needs to be automatic.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis has not been tested yet and is slowly being migrated from a working copy sans specific information for that use.\r\n[![githalytics.com alpha](https://cruel-carlota.pagodabox.com/e5cc4d27f7ebaa5a2d81276f31b2f9ae \"githalytics.com\")](http://githalytics.com/salbahra/Facebook-Group-Search)\r\n","google":"UA-40111352-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
